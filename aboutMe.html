<p>Around three months ago i went on my favorite hike called Eagle Peak which leads into the Three Sisters Falls in Descanso. Its a 4.2 mile hike there and back but it is very steep hike.
    It was around a 2 hour drive there and when we got there it was around 2pm, I was with three of my friends and it took us like an hour and a half to get to the falls and we stayed there to swim
    for about 3-4 hours. It was very beautiful. I would totally do it again but early in the morning because it was extremely hot and theres practically no shade for the first part of the hike.
